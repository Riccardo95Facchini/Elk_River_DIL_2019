<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Application developed for the [DIL-2019 Elk River Project](https://github.com/Riccardo95Facchini/DIL-2019).<br/>
Based on an older version of [Reservation](https://github.com/Riccardo95Facchini/Reservation) since the time constraints and the lack of knowledge in Android development from the other team members didn't allow for a development of a brand new application from the ground up.

### Main Features
* Searching for either a fishing instructor, a fishing spot or an equipment rental service in the Elk River area.
* Locals can add fishing spots via coordinates.
* Chat system.
* Notifications system for new chat messages and reservations.
* One app fits locals owners and users.
* Rating system.

### Built With
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
* [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)
